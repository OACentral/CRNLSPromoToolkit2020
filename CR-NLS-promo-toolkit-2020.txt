CENTRAL REGION NLS & DYLC PROMO TOOLKIT

Introduction
This toolkit was created with the purpose of assisting lodges and sections in promoting the National Leadership Seminar (NLS) and Developing Youth Leadership Conference (DYLC)


What are NLS and DYLC?
The National Leadership Seminar and the Developing Youth Leadership Conference are the premier leadership training programs within the Order of the Arrow. The National Leadership Seminar focuses on enhancing the leadership skills of key youth leaders and adult members, to become better leaders inside Scouting and within the greater community. The Developing Youth Leadership Conference focuses on growing the skills and knowledge of adult advisers to develop youth leadership at all levels.


Generic Information
We highly encourage using any means that your lodge or section has available to promote this event amongst your membership. To encourage this, we have provided a few social media posts (text and graphics) that you can post on your own platforms or adapt to emails and newsletters.  The official hashtag for National Leadership Seminar is #YesNLS.
